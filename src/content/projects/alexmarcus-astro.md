You're looking at it! AlexMarc.us is my personal portfolio and blog, built from the ground up using the Astro development framework. Astro’s static site generation enables lightning-fast page loads and a streamlined deployment process, making it ideal for a modern web presence.

### Custom Features & Development

The site features a fully custom codebase, including reusable components for layout, SEO, and navigation. I prioritized speed and ease of updates, leveraging Astro’s file-based routing and content collections to keep the site organized and maintainable. The project provided a great opportunity to learn Astro’s build process, component model, and integration with TypeScript.

### Why Astro?

[Astro](https://astro.build/) focuses on performance and developer experience made it a natural choice. Its ability to ship zero JavaScript by default, while still supporting interactive components when needed, keeps the site fast and efficient. The framework’s flexibility allowed me to experiment with new features and quickly iterate on design and content.
