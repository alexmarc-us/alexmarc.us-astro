Starbucks My Availability is a web application designed to help Starbucks partners (employees) manage and communicate their work schedule preferences. Built as a modern React front-end, the app integrates directly with the [Starbucks Partner Hours API](https://starbucks-partnerhours.us/starbucks-partner-hours-availability/) to provide seamless access to scheduling tools and availability management.

I was responsible for the initial project setup, team leadership, technical direction, design integration, deployment to production, and ongoing support for thousands of users across North America. My role included:

- Architecting the React front-end and establishing best practices for code quality and maintainability
- Integrating with Starbucks Partner Hours APIs for secure, real-time data exchange
- Collaborating with designers to deliver a user-friendly, accessible interface that matches Starbucks brand standards
- Leading a distributed engineering team, mentoring contributors, and driving technical decisions
- Overseeing deployment, monitoring, and support for a large user base

The app supports Starbucks' commitment to partner-centric scheduling and staffing ([see official statement](https://about.starbucks.com/press/2024/our-continued-commitment-to-partner-centric-scheduling-staffing/)), empowering partners to communicate their preferences and availability efficiently. The project required close coordination with Starbucks stakeholders, rapid iteration, and robust support processes to ensure reliability and satisfaction for thousands of users.
