The [Connecticut College Arboretum](https://www.conncoll.edu/the-arboretum/) has over 6,000 plants on its campus.  As part of the effort to catalog and organize these plants in a publicly-accessible manner, I created a web-based plant database.

The Find A Plant page utilized a MySQL database of plant information and JavaScript with XML to display all query-matching plants located on the campus.  The database was maintained by the collegeâ€™s Arboretum staff approximately once every year.  Administrative tasks are performed via a custom admin panel with features to add, modify, and delete plant entries, as well as upload CSV database files.
