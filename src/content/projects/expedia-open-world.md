At [Expedia Group](https://expediagroup.com/) I worked as a Senior Software engineer, guiding a team of engineers toward developing a scalable, production-ready technology platform. This solution involved implementing full-stack software integrated with Expedia Group APIs, including: 

- Web-based platform data servicing tools for internal administrators providing intuitive access to complex APIs

- Fine-grained authorization protocols for securing access to sensitive data using a relation based auth system

- Slack bot services in NodeJS with personalization, interaction templates, and learning platform integration

I worked closely with product, design, and program managers to determine project requirements, designs, and time lines. I also mentored technical contributors, including 2 interns, 3 development engineers, and 1 aspiring engineer.
