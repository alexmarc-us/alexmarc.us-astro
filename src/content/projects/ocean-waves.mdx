During a Programming Languages course at Connecticut College, I was challenged to create a shoreline wave simulation in the language of my choosing. I was interested in delving further into the world of web development, I chose JavaScript. This was my first utilization the HTML5 canvas tag with JavaScript to create live animations, and I enjoyed it thoroughly.

import WaveCanvas from '../../components/WaveCanvas.html';
